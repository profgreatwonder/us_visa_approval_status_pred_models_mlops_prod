# Elevating US Visa Application Outcome: A Production-Ready MLOps Solution for Predictive Insights and Enhanced Applicant Success

## Problem Statement

We want to be able to predict the "US Visa Approval Status" (approved or not) given the features - continent, education, job_experience, training, no_of_employee, current age, region_of_employment, prevailing_wage, contract_tenure, full_time, age_of_company, etc.

## Project Goal

This solution will help US visa applicant improve their chances at being selected during the application by providing advice based on the set criteria such as improving their resume.

## Solution Approach

- Machine Learning: Classification algorithm

## Solution Steps

- Load the data from the DB
- Perfrm EDA and feature engineering to select the desirable features
- Fit the ML classification algorithm and find out which one performs better
- Select top few and tune hyperparameters
- Select the best model based on desired metrics

## Technologies Used

- Docker
- Cloud Service
- Git and GitHub
- Github Actions
- Self Hosted Runner
- MongoDB for database
- Render for deployment
- Evidently (evaluate, test and monitor AI-powered products) to fix data div issues
